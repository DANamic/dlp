Code & Make @SG is an initiative by Infocomm Media Development Authority to develop computational thinking and making as a national capability in Singapore. It supports various educational programmes both in schools and the community.

Our programmes reach out to individuals and communities across all ages, providing them with opportunities to try their hands at a myriad of frontier technologies, understanding how they impact the way we work, live, learn, and play.

We aim to equip people with the ability to use technology optimally to achieve a better quality of life through computational thinking and making. 

There are 4 pillars in the computational thinking process.

### Why Computational Thinking?

Problem solving, coming up with and evaluating solutions, and recognising patterns in data are all important professional skills, whether or not someone decides to take up an ICT career. 

Computational thinking is essential in coding or computer science, but has benefits that extend beyond that, such as problem solving to increase the efficiency of a companyâ€™s processes, or coming up with new products and services for consumers. 

As the world continues to digitise, Code & Make @SG aims to provide an avenue for Singapore to build the capabilities necessary for continued economic prosperity and quality of life for all Singaporeans.
