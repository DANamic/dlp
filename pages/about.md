Code & Make @SG is an initiative by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) to develop computational thinking and making as a national capability in Singapore. 

Various programmes are run in schools and community that reach out to pre-schoolers, students and adults. By providing them with opportunities to try a myriad of coding and making technologies, we are shaping a generation of digital innovators, makers and creators who are passionate in using technology to solve real-world problems.

We aim to equip people with the ability to use technology optimally to achieve a better quality of life through computational thinking and making. 

There are 4 pillars in the computational thinking process.

### Understanding Computational Thinking

Problem solving, coming up with and evaluating solutions, and recognising patterns in data are all important professional skills, whether or not someone decides to take up an ICT career. 

Computational thinking is essential in coding or computer science, but has benefits that extend beyond that, such as problem solving to increase the efficiency of a companyâ€™s processes, or coming up with new products and services for consumers. 

As the world continues to digitise, Code & Make @SG aims to provide an avenue for Singapore to build the capabilities necessary for continued economic prosperity and quality of life for all Singaporeans.
