Code @SG is an initiative by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) to develop computational thinking and making as a national capability in Singapore. 

Various programmes are run in schools and community that reach out to pre-schoolers, students and adults. By providing them with opportunities to try a myriad of coding and making technologies, we are shaping a generation of digital innovators, makers and creators who are passionate in using technology to solve real-world problems.

### Why Computational Thinking?

Computational thinking involves problem solving, coming up with and evaluating solutions, and recognising patterns in data. Whether or not someone decides to take up an ICT career, these are all important professional skills with benefits that extend beyond coding and computer science

As the world continues to digitise, Code @SG aims to provide an avenue to take Singapore to the next level in the relevant capabiities.
