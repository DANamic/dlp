The project focuses on the safety of pedestrians near the traffic light junctions. When it is red man, the traffic light sensor will trigger the LED lights to blink, the warning message to display and the buzzer to sound when someone steps into the prohibited zone.

 

Once they move out of the zone, the LED lights will still be on and the warning message will still be displayed, but the buzzer will stop sounding. When the green man appears, the LED light and warning alert will be turned off. .<br>

**1.  Making the target** <br>Use colour printer to print the target. Laminate the target and drill a hole on the target and bottle cap. You need to trim the bottle cap because the jst connector is higher than the light sensor.<br>

**8. Connecting crocodile clips**<br>Remove the batteries from the laser pointer and glue the laser pointer to the top of the battery casing.

For my laser pointer, the spring (blue arrow) is -ve and the inner casing (orange arrow) is +ve. As the spring of the laser pointer is very difficult to access, I use a crocodile clip to clip on it.
 
-ve of battery connected to crocodile clip. The crocodile clip is clipped on to the spring indicated by the blue arrow. +ve of battery connected to micro switch. Another cable from micro switch to the inner casing of the laser pointer indicated by the orange arrow.<br>

---

**9. Tie and Solder**<br>Tie a cable tie around the switch of the laser pointer so that the switch remained depressed. Solder the micro switch and glue it to the battery case.<br>
