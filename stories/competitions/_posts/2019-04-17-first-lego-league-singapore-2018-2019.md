FIRST LEGO League (FLL) is a joint initiative by US-based FIRST (Foundation for Inspiration and Recognition in Science and Technology) and LEGO to inspire young people to get excited about careers in science and technology, by engaging them in exciting mentor-based programs that build science, engineering and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, and leadership.

The FIRST LEGO League targets students from 9-16 years old. FLL consists of two parts. The first part consists of a research project and a presentation based on the theme for the season. The second part consists of a robot game which requires students to build a robot using LEGO parts to complete missions on a challenge mat which is also based on the theme for the year.

This event is also co-organised by IMDA and is part of the National Infocomm Competition.
