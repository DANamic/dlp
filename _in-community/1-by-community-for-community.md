#### **Tech@Shopee: Coding for Youths**


**Shopee** provides opportunities for youths from low-income families who are keen on learning coding. During the 3-hour workshop, volunteer trainers will inspire and teach youths to code and understand the importance of coding. The workshop will begin with an introduction to Coding and Python, followed by hands-on acitivities with Python and creating a Chatbot. These workshops are customized to incorporate practical elements whereby participants have the opportunity to create and build real-world solutions to real problems. 



#### **Tiny Thinkers I & II**

![Tiny Thinkers II image](/images/in-community/overview/TinyThinkersII-6.jpg)


**Tiny Thinkers I** was started by a group of NTU students to introduce computational thinking to preschool children and their parents through specially-curated games on a dedicated website, hands-on workshops to guide parents and a Starter Kit filled with materials to kickstart the preschool children’s journey in computational thinking.  

Expanding from the Tiny Thinkers I project, Unfair advantage started **Tiny Thinkers II** to include more acitivities in the Junior Computational Thinking kit to kick-start preschool children's journey in computational thinking, conduct workshops to reach out to pre-schoolers from low-income families, and keep the website updated with more activities and resources for anyone to use.

![Hatch Immersive image](/images/in-community/overview/Hatch-Immersive-1.png)


**Hatch Immersive** targets youths from low-income, dropout, and at-risk backgrounds and brings them through a 1-month comprehensive training that comprise technical skills in either UI,UX Design or Digital Marketing, workplace skills and industry exposure. These provides them with the essential skills to enter the workforce and become independent. Upon successful completion of the training, youths will be given a 3-month internship opportunity in one of the partner companies. At the end of the internship, the youths would either convert to full-time or pursue further education. 

These Hatch Workshops target secondary school students who may not be excelling academically or are identified by the teachers to be “long-term absent”, to provide students with exposure to skills-based jobs and to build their self-confidence to secure these jobs.

**Engineering Good** conducted a **Tech for Good Festival** on 2nd November 2019 which celebrated how technology can help make life better for people with disabilities. Participants took part in workshops by Engineering Good and our partners, and learnt how they were able to help. Additionally, they also viewed a showcase of inventions by the Tech For Good contestants and partners. 

Additionally, Engineering Group is also conducting **“We Hack Care!” workshops** where participants will learn how to DIY low-cost assistive devices through simple engineering and donate the modified devices to VWOs and Special education schools (SPEDs) to support them in their training and daily activities.
