By Community, For Community are various ground-up projects by individuals or corporates to promote computational thinking and making for different communities. These projects are supported by Our Singapore Fund for Digital Readiness. <br><br>


#### **Tiny Thinkers I & II**


![overview image](/images/in-community/playmaker/20190914_0040.jpg)

**Tiny Thinkers I** was started by a group of NTU students to introduce computational thinking to preschool children and their parents through specially-curated games on a dedicated website, hands-on workshops to guide parents and a Starter Kit filled with materials to kickstart the preschool childrenâ€™s journey in computational thinking.  

Expanding from the Tiny Thinkers I project, Unfair advantage wants to include more acitivities in the Junior Computational Thinking kit to kick-start preschool children's journey in computational thinking, conduct workshops to reach out to pre-schoolers from low-income families, and keep the website updated with more activities and resources for anyone to use.
