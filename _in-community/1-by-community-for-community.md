By Community, For Community are various ground-up projects by individuals or corporates to promote computational thinking and making for different communities. These projects are supported by Our Singapore Fund for Digital Readiness. <br>


#### **Tiny Thinkers I & II**

<a href=""><img src="/images/in-community/playmaker/20190914_0040.jpg" align="left" height="40" width="40" ></a>

**Tiny Thinkers I** was started by a group of NTU students to introduce computational thinking to preschool children and their parents through specially-curated games on a dedicated website, hands-on workshops to guide parents and a Starter Kit filled with materials to kickstart the preschool children’s journey in computational thinking.  

Expanding from the Tiny Thinkers I project, Unfair advantage started **Tiny Thinkers II** to include more acitivities in the Junior Computational Thinking kit to kick-start preschool children's journey in computational thinking, conduct workshops to reach out to pre-schoolers from low-income families, and keep the website updated with more activities and resources for anyone to use.

#### **AppiLearn Mobile App**

AppiLearn was created by Angeline Teo and Lim Tian Yi who wanted to form an online community through a mobile application (app) and mobile-enabled website where learners from any background can have free and unlimited access to quality education resources and support, contributed by volunteers with a passion to share their knowledge and contribute to the society. 

This platform will enable teachers and volunteer tutors to create and share digital teaching contents which can be accessible by an unlimited number of students anytime and anywhere, allowing learners to learn at their own pace indefinitely.

Download Android version [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=AppiLearn&hl=en_US). iOS version releasing in November 2019.


#### **Hatch Immersive**

Hatch Immersive targets youth from low-income, dropout, and at-risk backgrounds and bring them through a 1-month comprehensive training that comprise technical skills in either UI,UX Design or Digital Marketing, workplace skills and industry exposure. Upon successful completion of the training, youth go through a 3-month internship in one of the partner companies. At the end of the internship, the youth would either convert to full-time or pursue further education. 

Hatch Workshops target secondary school students who may not be excelling academically or are identified by the teachers to be “long-term absent”, to provide students with exposure to skills-based jobs and to build their self-confidence to secure these jobs.

#### **Engineering Good**

Engineering Group wants to conduct “We Hack Care!” workshops where participants will learn how to DIY low-cost assistive devices through simple engineering and donate the modified devices to VWOs and Special education schools (SPEDs) to support them in their training and daily activities.

There is also a “Tech For Good” (T4G) social innovation challenge that aims to bring together different community segments to help them learn about assistive technology, how it supports persons with disabilities and basic engineering concepts. Competition teams will be paired with social sector organisations to ideate and prototype the solutions with the help of skilled mentors. The teams will then present to a panel of judges and share their prototypes with participants at a one-day Tech For Good Festival Showcase.
