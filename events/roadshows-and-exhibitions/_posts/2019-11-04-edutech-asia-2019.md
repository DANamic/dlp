Technology is changing the way we live, work and learn. This is having a profound impact on how we teach, where we teach and what we teach. At EduTECH Asia 2019, this is what will be discussed, debated and workshopped. 

Educators from across the entire education spectrum will be brought together: from early years practitioners through to K-12 and tertiary education leaders, and from across Asia!
