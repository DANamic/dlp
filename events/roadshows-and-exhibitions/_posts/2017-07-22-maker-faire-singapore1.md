Come and look for us at our Digital Maker booth where there are many exciting projects powered by micro:bit for you to try and explore. Here are some highlights. 

 

**Program your Race Car and Compete!**<br>
Explore robotics with a micro:bit-powered car. Use an RC controller to navigate, or equip the micro:bit car with sensors so that it can navigate its world autonomously. Race against one another on the track to see who is faster, an autonomous or a human-controller car?

 

**Fire your Air Cannon!**<br>
Play off against each other in a micro:bit powered game where the winner gets to fire their air cannon first!

 

**Angry Bird Catapult**<br>
See who can shoot their angry bird the furthest possible!

 

**Fiddle with Micro:bit**<br>
Code your first program on the micro:bit in minutes on the user-friendly Microsoft MakeCode's code editor. Make a simple animation or a digital compass.
