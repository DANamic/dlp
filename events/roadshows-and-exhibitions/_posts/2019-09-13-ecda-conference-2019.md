The Early Childhood Conference and Exhibition is an annual event organised by the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA). Featuring talks and exhibitions that introduce fresh and innovative ways to engage young children in holistic learning, this event is a must attend for parents and early childhood educators alike! 

A key highlight of the conference is the "Bringing Computational Thinking to PreSchools and Homes" workshop, where parents and educators can learn effective and fun ways to introduce the concepts of coding and computational thinking from a young age.
