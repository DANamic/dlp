Code Quest is an annual computer programming competition where teams of two to three secondary school, junior college or polytechnics/ITE students work together for two-and-a-half hours to solve problems using JAVA, Python, VB.net, C#, and/or C++ programming. The problem set consists of 15-20 challenging problems created by <a href="" target="_blank">Lockheed Martin</a> engineers and computer programmers.

Code Quest started back in 2012 with 15 teams competing in Texas and has now grown to over 650 teams competing across 28 cities internationally. Now, Code Quest is back in Singapore! 

The competition will be held on Saturday, 2nd May, at Temasek Polytechnic. Registration for Code Quest Singapore is now open!
