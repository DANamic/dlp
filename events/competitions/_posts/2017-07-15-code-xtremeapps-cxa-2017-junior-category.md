code::XtremeApps:: (CXA) is a hackathon jointly organised by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and the IT Standards Committee (ITSC).

 

It is aimed at creating greater awareness of and inspiring the use and value of programming and standards, as well as fostering collaboration with and within the programming community. The annual event was launched in 2007 with about 60 participating teams and has grown consistently over the years.

 

The hackathon offers a month of various training classes to help ensure participants understand how to use the technology before the competition. These classes range from programming and coding to hands-on with emerging technologies such as the cloud, open data, robotics or the Internet of Things. It enables budding and current developers the perfect opportunity to share and learn more, as well as develop the seeds of innovative solutions.

 

Classes are catered for different levels and include child-friendly classes based on the technologies utilized during the competition. For example, the Junior Category classes learning to use a simple microcontroller to solve problems.

 

**Junior Category**


The Junior Category is open to students of Primary School (age 12 and below) is in line with the Digital Maker Programme to nurture a new generation of digital natives to be creators and makers. It features a three-hour competition using micro:bit to create solutions to solve a challenge. The micro:bit is a pocket-sized, codeable microcontroller with various features like motion detection and Bluetooth technology. Participants will use micro:bits to experiment, explore and learn in a fun and educational way. They will learn basic coding and making to solve daily problems. In addition, every participant will get to bring home a micro:bit at the end of the competition.
