The Singapore Space Challenge (SSC) is a highly anticipated national space design competition that challenges student teams to leverage space technology; from satellite mapping to GPS and GNSS. We encourage innovation in engineering to conceptualise and design space-related projects to tackle real-world challenges from disasters to improving the quality of life. The challenge is held annually and is organised by the Singapore Space and Technology Association (SSTA).
