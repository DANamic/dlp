This workshop is for participants aged 10 and above.
Registration is required (at library e-kiosks or at click <a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/golibrary2/e/digital-maker-spin-art-pixel-labsnlb-70560457" target="_blank">here</a> to register!) and material fee **($15 per pax)** is payable to the organizer.

Wondering how to spend your time this June holiday? 
Join us for this 2-hour workshop that allows the participants to learn how to programme a micro:bit to be a Spin Art machine (a machine where art can be created easily).

Each participant is entitled to only one micro:bit and a set of kit. Hence, participants are required to bring their own micro:bits if they have received one from IMDA Digital Maker workshops previously.

A minimum of 10 participants is required to start the workshop.

Participants are advised to arrive 15 minutes before the start of the workshop, as allocated seats will be released to interested participants 5 minutes after the start of the workshop.

This workshop is proudly brought to you by Info-communications Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA).
