In the month of October, some of our friends who are studying may be feeling the anxiety & heat from upcoming exams.  Take some time off to join our 2-hours Digital Maker workshops to chill, de-stress and refocus by doing some interesting projects involving coding and making!  In the 2-hour workshop, you will create a mood lamp, a mesmerising light ornament that transitions into different colours. Learn how to program your micro:bit to adjust the speed of light transition, or to display different colours depending on your mood!

The workshop and the micro:bits are sponsored by IMDA.  However, there will be material costs involved and each set of kit costs $10.  Participants are to pay the trainers directly for the kits at the workshop at the start of the registration to bring back the project.

Registration is required. Click <a href="https://nlb.gov.sg/golibrary" target="_blank">here</a> to register* or at library e-kiosks.

*Registration open 2 weeks before workshop date

A minimum of 10 paxs is required to start the workshop.
Participants are advised to arrive 15minutes before the start of the workshop, as allocated seats will be released to interested participants 5 minutes after the start of the workshop.

This workshop is proudly brought to you by Info-communications Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA).
