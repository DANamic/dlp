A toy can make any person of any age or ability level want to keep growing and learning. A child with sensory dysfunction needs to engage with toys early on. Toys also promote independent play and social interaction, which can be challenging for children with autism. One in six children is diagnosed with a developmental disability, and there are not many toys that focus on this.

In Tech Pals, we will be solving problems in our community by making and using the human-centred design approach to design our solution. Join us in this 8-week program, to understand how children with special needs learn through play and create something purposeful for the beneficiaries. Sign up here: http://bit.ly/TechPals<br>
