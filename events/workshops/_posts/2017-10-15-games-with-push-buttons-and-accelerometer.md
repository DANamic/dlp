Join our free Digital Making workshop at Tampines Regional Library. 


This workshop introduces participants to micro:bit hardware, the block-based programming environment, PXT and how to create a simple digital game with both push buttons and the accelerometer as input such as battleship using the micro:bit. Participants will also learn how to give instructions using the block-based programming environment to display different images, how to upload the program onto the microcontroller and how to use push buttons and the accelerometer on the micro:bit as a form of input, how to use the accelerometer to change the location of the targeting LED on the grid and how to use push button to trigger a detonation action.
