A minimum of 12 pax is required to start the workshop.

In this workshop, you will learn coding through music! Get to know how a small piezo buzzer can sound loud through making a boombox to amplify its sound. Join us now to replicate your favourite hits on Micro:bit.
  
This programme is suitable for participants aged 10 and above. Each person is entitled to only one micro:bit hence participants are required to bring their own micro:bits if they have received one from previous IMDA Digital Maker workshops.

Registration is required and material fee ($5 per pax) is payable to the organizer. Registration is required at library e-kiosks or at http://nlb.gov.sg/golibrary.
  
Participants are advised to arrive 15 min before workshop time, as allocated seats will be released to interested participants 10 minutes after the start of the workshop.
 
This Digital Maker workshop is proudly brought to you by Info-communications Media Authority of Singapore (IMDA).
