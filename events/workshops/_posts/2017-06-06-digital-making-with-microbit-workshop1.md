Join this hands-on workshop that uses mirco:bit to learn the fundamentals of coding and making. During the workshop, you will progress from drag-and-drop coding to creating your own projects like crafting customised LED messages, playing music or making your own step tracker - the possibilities are endless. 

Suitable for children ages 9 to 12, this workshop will teach them basic programming skills and inspire them to be creative and make things with technology. Each parent-child pair will be given a Micro:bit to take home and continue the learning and making.
