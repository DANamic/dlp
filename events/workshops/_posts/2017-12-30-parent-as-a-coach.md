One of the most rewarding time with our children is to be a coach to them.

Unfortunately, because of high expectations or impatience, our children cannot receive the best of what we have to offer them.

This talk focuses on how fathers can coach in a way that will increase confidence in our children to accomplish a task or challenge. Practical insights will be shared that can be applied immediately in the follow on Digital Making activity!
