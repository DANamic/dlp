Join us for a 2-hour workshop where participants will learn how to programme a micro:bit to control a Desk Fan. 

This workshop will be held at Jurong Regional Library.

 

Each participant is entitled to only one micro:bit and a set of kit. Hence, participants are required to bring their own micro:bits if they have received one from IMDA Digital Maker workshops previously.
The workshop and the micro:bits are sponsored by IMDA.  However, there will be material costs involved and each set of kit costs $15. 

 

Participants are to pay the trainers directly for the kits during the workshop registration to complete the project.
Participants are also required to bring their own writing materials and laptop if they wish to save the codes created during the workshop.
