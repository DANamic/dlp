Registration is required and material fee ($10 per pax) is payable to the organizer. Registration is required at library e-kiosks or click <a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/golibrary2/e/digital-maker-make-your-own-mini-basketball-catapult-pixel-labsnlb-16804509" target="_blank">here</a> to register.

A minimum of 10 pairs is required to start the workshop.

Kick start your journey to create arcade games at home. You can learn how you can use materials found at home or in your vicinity to make Arcade games. Join us as we learn how to use the Micro:bit to do automatic scoring system like how real arcades do.
  
This programme is suitable for participants aged 7-12 years old, with an accompanying adult. Each pair is entitled to only one micro:bit hence participants are required to bring their own micro:bits if they have received one from previous IMDA Digital Maker workshops.

Participants are advised to arrive 15min before workshop time, as allocated seats will be released to interested participants 10 minutes after the start of the workshop.

This Digital Maker workshop is proudly brought to you by Info-communications Media Authority of Singapore (IMDA).
