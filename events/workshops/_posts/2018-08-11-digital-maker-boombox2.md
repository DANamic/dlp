This workshop is suitable for participants aged 10 and above.

Registration is required (at library e-kiosks or click <a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/golibrary2/e/digital-maker-boombox-pixel-labsnlb-28549423" target="_blank">here</a> to register) and material fee ($5 per pax) is payable to the organizer.

In August, we come together to commemorate and celebrate Singaporeâ€™s independence.  Come join us at our 2-hours Digital Maker workshops to express your well wishes for our nation by coding and making some interesting projects. In the 2-hour workshop, you will learn coding through music! Get to know how a small piezo buzzer can sound loud through making a boombox to amplify its sound. Join us now to replicate your favourite hits on Micro:bit.

The workshop and the micro:bits are sponsored by IMDA.  However, there will be material costs involved and each set of kit costs $5.  Participants are to pay the trainers directly for the kits at the workshop at the start of the registration to bring back the project.

A minimum of 10 participants is required to start the workshop.

Participants are advised to arrive 15 minutes before the start of the workshop, as allocated seats will be released to interested participants 5 minutes after the start of the workshop.
 
This workshop is proudly brought to you by Info-communications Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA).
