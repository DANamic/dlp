In the month of October, some of our friends who are studying may be feeling the anxiety & heat from upcoming exams.  Take some time off to join our 2-hours Digital Maker workshops to chill, de-stress and refocus by doing some interesting projects involving coding and making!  In the 2-hour workshop, you will learn how to make a terrarium and automate the process of taking care of your terrarium. You will learn how to use the microbit coupled with light and moisture sensors to tell you whereâ€™s a good place to put your terrarium.

The workshop and the micro:bits are sponsored by IMDA.  However, there will be material costs involved and each set of kit costs $20.  Participants are to pay the trainers directly for the kits at the workshop at the start of the registration to bring back the project.

 
Registration is required. Click <a href="https://nlb.gov.sg/golibrary" target="_blank">here</a> to register* or at library e-kiosks.
