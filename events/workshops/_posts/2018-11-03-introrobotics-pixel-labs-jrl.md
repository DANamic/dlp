This is a 2-day workshop happening from 1pm-5pm on Saturday, 3 Nov and Sunday, 4 Nov 2018. Participants are required to attend BOTH days of the workshop.

Participants are required to pay a material fee of $30 directly to the trainer during workshop registration to attend this workshop.

This 2-day (8 hours in total) course aims to equip participants with graphical/block programming skills using MakeCode from Microsoft and the knowledge of how to interface different kinds of sensors (ie. light sensor, temperature sensor, etc) and actuators (ie. LED, DC motor, buzzer, etc) with the Micro:bit microcontroller.

In this course, participants will build a motion-activated LED lamp which will be switched on automatically in the presence of a person, and  off after the person has left for some time.

This workshop will be held at Jurong Regional Library. 

The training provided in this workshop is sponsored by IMDA.
