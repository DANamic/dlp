Have you ever wanted a gift box that has a spotlight on the gift and produces an “Ahhh” sound when you open it or make some spooky noises when someone opens your box? If so, this is the workshop just for you! Sustainable Living Lab will teach you how to infuse technology into gift boxes - from a simple birthday present to a Halloween surprise, and even a marriage proposal. Join us now to make your very own music gift box.
This programme is suitable for participants aged 18 years and above.
- Each person is entitled to only one micro:bit. Hence, participants are required to bring their own micro:bits if they have received one from previous IMDA Digital Maker workshops.
- There will be a materials fee of $10 per participant, payable by cash to the organiser before the start of the workshop.
- Participants are advised to arrive 15min before the start of the workshop, as allocated seats will be released to interested participants 5 minutes after the start of the workshop.
