In August, we come together to commemorate and celebrate Singaporeâ€™s independence. Come join us at our 2-hours Digital Maker workshop to express your well wishes for our nation by coding and making some interesting projects. In the 2-hour your workshop, you will learn how to create and program an exclusive National Day themed Spin Art Machine using a micro:bit! 

Each participant is entitled to only one micro:bit and a set of kit. Hence, participants are required to bring their own micro:bits if they have received one from IMDA Digital Maker workshops previously.

A minimum of 10 participants is required to start the workshop.

Participants are advised to arrive 15 minutes before the start of the workshop, as allocated seats will be released to interested participants 5 minutes after the start of the workshop.
