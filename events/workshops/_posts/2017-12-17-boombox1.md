In this workshop, you will learn coding through music! Get to know how a small piezo buzzer can sound loudly by making a boombox to amplify its sound. Join us now to replicate your favourite hits on Micro:bit.

 

Each Singaporean/PR is entitled to only one micro:bit. Participants are required to bring their own micro:bits if they have received one from previous IMDA Digital Maker workshops.
Participants are required to arrive 30 minutes before the start of workshop, as all slots will be released at the start of workshop to participants on waiting list.

Materials fee of $5 is payable by cash to the trainer before the start of the workshop.
Registration is required <a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/golibrary2/e/digital-maker-boombox-99961110" target="_blank">here</a> or at library e-kiosks.
