This workshop is suitable for participants aged 7 and above, with an accompanying adult.
Registration is required (at library e-kiosks or at click <a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/golibrary2/e/digital-maker-mini-finger-soccer-pixel-labsnlb-19667583" target="_blank">here</a> to register) and material fee **($10 per parent-child pair)** is payable to the organizer.

We celebrate Fatherâ€™s Day in the month of June and this is part of a series of workshops where a parent and child can work together on a project to present to the father, honouring him in the family. It also encourages parent-child bonding.

In this 2-hour workshop, you will learn how you can use materials found at home or in your vicinity to make a mini finger soccer game. Join us as we learn how to use the Micro:bit to create an automatic scoring system.

Each parent-child pair of participants is entitled to only one micro:bit and a set of kit. Hence, participants are required to bring their own micro:bits if they have received one from IMDA Digital Maker workshops previously.

A minimum of 5 pairs is required to start the workshop. Participants are advised to arrive 15minutes before the start of the workshop, as allocated seats will be released to interested participants 5 minutes after the start of the workshop.

This workshop is proudly brought to you by Info-communications Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA).
