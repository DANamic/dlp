This workshop introduces participants to micro:bit hardware, the block-based programming environment, PXT and how to create a simple digital game such as Battleship with both push buttons and the accelerometer as input using the micro:bit. 

Participants will also learn how to:
- Give instructions using the block-based programming environment to display different images.
- Upload the programme onto the microcontroller.
- Use push buttons and the accelerometer on the micro:bit as a form of input.
- Use the accelerometer to change the location of the targeting LED on the grid.
- Use push button to trigger an evasive action.


This workshop will be held at Jurong Regional Library.

This programme is suitable for participants aged 10 and above. Participants aged 7 to 9 must be accompanied by a guardian aged 16 and above.

Participants are required to bring writing materials and their own microbit if they have received one at previous IMDA Digital Maker workshops. 

Admission is free and registration is required here or at library e-kiosks.

Participants are advised to arrive 15 minutes before the start of the workshop, as allocated seats will be released to interested participants 5 minutes after the start of the workshop.
