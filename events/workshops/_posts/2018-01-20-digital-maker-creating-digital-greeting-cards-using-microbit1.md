This workshop introduces participants to micro:bit hardware, the block-based programming environment, PXT and how to create a simple greeting message using animations and text with musical notes when button A is pressed. Make a simple greeting card with musical notes using the piezo speaker, strawbees and cardboard. Material fee ($12 per pax) includes one piezo buzzer, two crocodile wires, strawbees and a customised cardboard.

Participants will also learn how to:
- Give instructions using the block-based programming environment to display different images,
- Upload the program onto the microcontroller,
- Display messages and music by pressing a button,
- Program the piezo speaker and connect to the micro:bit to play musical notes when button A is pressed.
 
This workshop will be held at Jurong Regional Library.
 
This programme is suitable for participants aged 7 years and above.

Each person is entitled to only one micro:bit. Hence, participants are required to bring their own micro:bit if they have received one from previous IMDA Digital Maker workshops.

Participants are also required to bring their own writing materials and laptop if they wish to save the codes created during the workshop.

Registration is required at library e-kiosks or at http://nlb.gov.sg/golibrary. A material fee of $12 per pax is payable by cash to the organiser before the start of the workshop.
