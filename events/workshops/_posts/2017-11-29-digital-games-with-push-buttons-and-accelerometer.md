This workshop introduces participants to micro:bit hardware, the block-based programming environment, PXT and how to create a simple digital game such as Battleship with both push buttons and the accelerometer as input using the micro:bit. 

Participants will also learn how to:
- Give instructions using the block-based programming environment to display different images.
 -Upload the programme onto the microcontroller.
 -Use push buttons and the accelerometer on the micro:bit as a form of input.
 -Use the accelerometer to change the location of the targeting LED on the grid.
 -Use push button to trigger an evasive action.
 
This workshop will be held at Jurong Regional Library.

This programme is suitable for participants aged 10 and above. Participants aged 7 to 9 must be accompanied by a guardian aged 16 and above.

Participants are required to bring writing materials and their own microbit if they have received one at previous IMDA Digital Maker workshops.
