Wonder how to spend your time in this June holiday?  

 

Come join us for this 2-hour workshop that allows the participants to learn how to programme a micro:bit to control a Desktop Fan. 
This workshop will be held at Tampines Regional Library.

 

Each participant is entitled to only one micro:bit and a set of kit. Hence, participants are required to bring their own micro:bits if they have received one from IMDA Digital Maker workshops previously.
The workshop and the micro:bits are sponsored by IMDA. 

However, there will be material costs involved and each set of kit costs $15. 

 

Participants are to pay the trainers directly for the kits at the workshop during registration to complete the project.
Admission is free and registration is required.

A minimum of 10 pairs is required to start the workshop.

 

Participants are advised to arrive 15 minutes before the start of the workshop, as allocated seats will be released to interested participants 5 minutes after the start of the workshop.

This workshop is proudly brought to you by Info-communications Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA).
