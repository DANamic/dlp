This workshop introduces participants to micro:bit hardware and the block-based programming environment, PXT. They will learn how to create a simple greeting card with animation and text with musical notes using the piezo speaker strawbees and cardboard. 

Participants will also learn how to
- Give instructions using the block-based programming environment to display different images
- Upload the program onto the micro:bit
- Display messages and music by pressing a button
- Program the piezo speaker and connect to the micro:bit to play musical notes when a button is pressed.
- This workshop will be held at Jurong Regional Library.

This programme is suitable for participants aged 10 years and above, and also adults and seniors.
Participants are required to bring their own writing materials and their own laptop if they wish to save the codes created during the workshop.
