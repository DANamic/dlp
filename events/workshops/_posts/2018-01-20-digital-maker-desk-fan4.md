Did you know that you can now build your own desk fan and program it? Join us to learn how to build your own desktop fan and program it to operate using micro:bit.

Participants will be introduced to:
- Coding and Computational Thinking
- Block-based programming
- micro:bit and its sensors

 They will also learn how to:
- Appreciate how technology can help people
- Build their very own desk fan and integrate it with micro:bit
- Apply the concept and knowledge that they have learnt through real-life problems


This workshop will be held at Jurong Regional Library.

This programme is suitable for participants aged 10 years old and above.
