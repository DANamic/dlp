In the month of October, some of our friends who are studying may be feeling the anxiety & heat from upcoming exams.  Take some time off to join our 2-hours Digital Maker workshops to chill, de-stress and refocus by doing some interesting projects involving coding and making!  In the 2-hour workshop, you will be introduced to the micro:bit hardware, the block-based programming environment and how to create innovative digital game with accelerometer using the micro:bit. 

Participants will also learn how to 

• Give instructions using the block-based programming environment to display different images, 
• Upload the program onto the micro:bit 

• Use accelerometer on the micro:bit as a form of input, 

• Use accelerometer to change the location of the LED on the grid and randomly display images by tilting the microbits.


 The workshop and the micro:bits are sponsored by IMDA.
