In August, we come together to commemorate and celebrate Singaporeâ€™s independence.  Come join us at our 2-hour Digital Maker workshops to express your well wishes for our nation by coding and making some interesting projects. 
 
In the 2-hour workshop, you will be introduced to the micro:bit hardware, the block-based programming environment and how to create a digital greeting card using the micro:bit.
 
Participants will also learn how to:
Give instructions using the block-based programming environment to display different images,
Upload the program onto the micro:bit,
Use push buttons on the micro:bit as a form of input,
Display messages and music by pressing a button.
 
This workshop will be held at Taman Jurong Community Club.
 
This workshop is for children aged 10 and above.
 
Each participant is entitled to only one micro:bit and one kit. Hence, participants are required to bring their own micro:bits if they have received one from previous IMDA Digital Maker workshops.
 
The workshop and the micro:bits are sponsored by IMDA.  However, there will be a $12 materials fee for each kit.  Participants are to make payment directly to the trainers for the kits at the start of the workshop if they wish to bring their project home.

Registration is required at Taman Jurong CC.
 
A minimum of 10 pax is required to start the workshop.
 
Participants are advised to arrive 15minutes before the start of the workshop, as allocated seats will be released to interested participants 5 minutes after the start of the workshop.
 
This workshop is proudly brought to you by Info-communications Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA).
