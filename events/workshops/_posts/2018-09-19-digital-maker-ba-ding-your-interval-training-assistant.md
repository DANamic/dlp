Want to stay fit & healthy but have no time? Start doing interval training by building your very own interval training assistant! In this workshop, you will learn how to control an ultrasonic sensor & buzzer with the micro:bit. We will teach you how to make a timekeeping micro:bit assistant. It will display the next exercise such as push-ups and sit ups, keep track of your number of repetitions and even play notifications, alerting you to start the next exercise. 

The workshop and the micro:bits are sponsored by IMDA.  However, there will be material costs involved and each set of kit costs $35.  Participants are to pay the trainers directly for the kits at the workshop at the start of the registration to bring back their invention and stay keeping fit at home!
