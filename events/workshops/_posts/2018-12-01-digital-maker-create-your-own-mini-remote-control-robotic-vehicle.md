In this 2-hour workshop, you will be introduced to the micro:bit hardware, the block-based programming environment and to program the push buttons and accelerometer as a form of input. The participants will also learn how to:
- Assemble the mini remote control robotic vehicle and controller
- Program the robotic vehicle to be controlled using the controller
- Using the cardboard provided, add on designs to the remote control robotic vehicle.

This workshop will be held at Jurong Regional Library.

The training provided in this workshop is sponsored by IMDA.
 
**Participate in our Digital Maker workshop and bring home a micro:bit!**
 
As part of the Digital Maker programme initiative, registered participants for the workshops can bring home a **ONE-TIME** free issue of the pocket-sized **micro:bit** , sponsored by IMDA.
 
Terms of receiving a free micro:bit
