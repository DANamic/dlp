A mood lamp is a mesmerising light ornament that transitions into different colours. Program your micro:bit to adjust the speed of light transition, or to display different colours depending on your mood! Participants will get a chance to assemble a mood lamp project kit and learn basic micro:bit coding in this workshop.
 
This programme is suitable for adults and seniors.

Each person is entitled to only one micro:bit hence participants are required to bring their own micro:bits if they have received one from previous IMDA Digital Maker workshop
