This workshop is suitable for participants aged 10 and above. Registration is required and material fee ($10 per participant) is payable to the organizer. Registration is required at library e-kiosks or at <a href="http://nlb.gov.sg/golibrary" target="_blank">http://nlb.gov.sg/golibrary</a> 

In the month of October, some of our friends who are studying may be feeling the anxiety & heat from upcoming exams.  Take some time off to join our 2-hours Digital Maker workshops to chill, de-stress and refocus by doing some interesting projects involving coding and making!  

In the 2-hour workshop, you will create a mood lamp, a mesmerising light ornament that transitions into different colours. Learn how to program your micro:bit to adjust the speed of light transition, or to display different colours depending on your mood!

The workshop will be held at Tampines Regional Library. The training provided in this workshop is sponsored by IMDA.

Participate in our Digital Maker workshop and bring home a micro:bit!
As part of the Digital Maker programme initiative, registered participants for the workshops can bring home a ONE-TIME free issue of the pocket-sized micro:bit , sponsored by IMDA.
