This workshop introduces participants to micro:bit hardware, the block-based programming environment, PXT and how to create a simple digital game such as Battleship with both push buttons and the accelerometer as input using the micro:bit. 

Participants will also learn how to:
- Give instructions using the block-based programming environment to display different images.
- Upload the programme onto the microcontroller.
- Use push buttons and the accelerometer on the micro:bit as a form of input.
- Use the accelerometer to change the location of the targeting LED on the grid.
- Use push button to trigger an evasive action.

This programme is suitable for participants aged 10 - 12 years old. Participants aged 7 to 9 must be accompanied by a guardian aged 16 and above.


Each person is entitled to only one micro:bit hence participants are required to bring their own micro:bits if they have received one from previous IMDA Digital Maker workshops.
Participants are required to bring their own writing materials. 

Participants are advised to arrive 15 minutes before the start of the workshop, as allocated seats will be released to interested participants 5 minutes after the start of the workshop.ats will be released to interested participants 5 minutes after the start of the workshop.
