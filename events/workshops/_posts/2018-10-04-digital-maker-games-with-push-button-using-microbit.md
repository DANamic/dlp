In the month of October, some of our friends who are studying may be feeling the anxiety & heat from upcoming exams.  Take some time off to join our 2-hours Digital Maker workshops to chill, de-stress and refocus by doing some interesting projects involving coding and making!  In the 2-hour workshop, you will be introduced to the micro:bit hardware, the block-based programming environment and how to create innovative digital game with push button using the micro:bit. 

Participants will also learn how to 

• Give instructions using the block-based programming environment to display different images, 

• Upload the program onto the micro:bit

• Use push buttons on the micro:bit as a form of input, 

• Use the LED grid to randomly display images by pressing a button

Such as scissor/paper/stone

• Use push button to trigger an evasive action.


The workshop and the micro:bits are sponsored by IMDA.
