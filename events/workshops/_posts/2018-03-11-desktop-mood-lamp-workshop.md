A mood lamp is a mesmerising light ornament that transitions into different colours. Program your micro:bit to adjust the speed of light transition, or to display different colours depending on your mood!
- This programme is suitable for participants aged 18 years and above.
- Each person is entitled to only one micro:bit. Hence, participants are required to bring their own micro:bits if they have received one from previous IMDA Digital Maker workshops.
- There will be a materials fee of $10 per participant, payable by cash to the organiser before the start of the workshop.
- Participants are advised to arrive 15min before the start of the workshop, as allocated seats will be released to interested participants 5 minutes after the start of the workshop.
