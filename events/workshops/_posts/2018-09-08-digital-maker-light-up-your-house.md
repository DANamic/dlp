Wouldn’t it be cool if your lights at home turn on automatically when the sun sets? In this workshop, you will use the micro:bit to turn on your lights with the wave of your hand. What’s more? You get to create amazing rainbow lights with our multicolour LED ring! 

The workshop and the micro:bits are sponsored by IMDA.  However, there will be material costs involved and each set of kit costs $40.  Participants are to pay the trainers directly for the kits at the workshop at the start of the registration to bring back their smart light invention.

 

Registration is required. Click <a href="https://nlb.gov.sg/golibrary" target="_blank">here</a> to register* or at library e-kiosks.
