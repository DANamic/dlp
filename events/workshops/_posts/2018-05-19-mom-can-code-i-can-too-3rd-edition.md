GITSG is bringing back our annual mother-daughter coding workshop for the 3rd time this year, in conjunction with mother's day. After overwhelming responses from the community for the past 2 years, this year, GITSG is partnering with IMDA to bring more hands-on interactive and fun coding to the public under IMDA's Digital Maker Programme. 

The objective of this program is to encourage more girls to pick up and fall in love with programming from a young age, and encourage this passion to endure though adulthood such that they will not be easily deterred in pursuing tech-related careers later in life. Mothers are a girls' first female role models and we want to exemplify that by letting moms lead their daughters by example in this coding workshop. At the end of this workshop, the mother-daughter pair can look forward to bringing home their own e-ukulele

A few testimonials from mothers who attended the event:

“It’s been 5 hours since the event finished and my kids are still on the computer coding with Scratch. I think you converted a couple of little people!”
