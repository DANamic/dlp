In celebration of Fatherâ€™s Day this June, this workshop is part of a series that brings both parent and child together to work on a project to honour fathers and encourage parent-child bonding.
 
In this 2-hour workshop, participants will learn to use materials found at home or in their vicinity to make a mini basketball catapult. Join us as we learn how to use the Micro:bit to do automatic scoring system.
 
This workshop will be held at Jurong Regional Library.
 
This workshop is for parent-child pairs only.  Children participants need to be at least 7 years old, and must be paired with either a parent or a guardian aged 18 years and above.
 
Each pair is entitled to only one micro:bit and a set of kit Hence, participants are required to bring their own micro:bits if they have received one from IMDA Digital Maker workshops previously.
 
The workshop and the micro:bits are sponsored by IMDA. However, there will be material costs involved and each set of kit costs $10. Parents are to pay the trainers directly for the kits during the workshop registration to be able to bring back the project.
 
Participants are also required to bring their own writing materials and laptop if they wish to save the codes created during the workshop.
 
Admission is free and registration is required at library e-kiosks or at http://nlb.gov.sg/golibrary.
 
A minimum of 10 pairs is required to start the workshop.
 
Participants are advised to arrive 15minutes before the start of the workshop, as allocated seats will be released to interested participants 5 minutes after the start of the workshop.
 
This workshop is proudly brought to you by Info-communications Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA).
