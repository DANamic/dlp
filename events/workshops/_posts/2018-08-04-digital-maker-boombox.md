In August, we come together to commemorate and celebrate Singaporeâ€™s independence.  Come join us at our 2-hour Digital Maker workshops to express your well wishes for our nation by coding and making some interesting projects. 
 
In this 2 hour workshop, you will learn coding through music! Get to know how a small piezo buzzer can sound loud through making a boombox to amplify its sound. Join us now to replicate your favourite hits on micro:bit.
 
This workshop will be held at Jurong Regional Library.
 
This workshop is for participants aged 10 years and above.
 
Each participant is entitled to only one micro:bit and one kit. Hence, participants are required to bring their own micro:bits if they have received one from previous IMDA Digital Maker workshops.
 
The workshop and the micro:bits are sponsored by IMDA.  However, there will be a $5 materials fee for each equipment kit.  Participants are to make payment directly to the trainers for the kits at the start of the workshop if they wish to bring their project home.
 
Admission is free and registration is required at library e-kiosks or click <a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/golibrary2/e/digital-maker-boombox-pixel-labsnlb-51792304" target="_blank">here</a> to register 
 
A minimum of 10 pax is required to start the workshop.
 
Participants are advised to arrive 15minutes before the start of the workshop, as allocated seats will be released to interested participants 5 minutes after the start of the workshop.
 
This workshop is proudly brought to you by Info-communications Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA).
