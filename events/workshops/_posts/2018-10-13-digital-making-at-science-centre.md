Tinker Technique is a parent-child workshop which aims to develop our next generation with lifelong skills. It is also a fun family-bonding session!

Our workshop explores specific STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics) concepts and tool techniques, like hammering and hot glue gun. At the end of the workshops, your child will be equipped with fine motor skills and the confidence to embrace the future of limitless discovery.

Join this hands-on workshop that uses micro:bit to learn the fundamentals of coding and making. During the workshop, you will progress from drag-and-drop coding to creating your own projects like crafting customised LED messages, playing music or making your own step tracker - the possibilities are endless. 

Suitable for children aged 9 to 12, this workshop will teach them basic programming skills and inspire them to be creative and make things with technology. Each parent-child pair will be given a Micro:bit to take home to continue the learning and making.
