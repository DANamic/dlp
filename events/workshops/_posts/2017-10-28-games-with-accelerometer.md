Participants will also learn how to:

- Give instructions using the block-based programming environment to display different images
- Upload the program onto the microcontroller
- Use the accelerometer on the micro:bit as a form of input
- Use the accelerometer to change the location of the LED on the grid

This programme is suitable for participants aged 10-12.
