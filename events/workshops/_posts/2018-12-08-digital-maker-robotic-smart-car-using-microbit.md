**This is a 2-day workshop happening from 1pm-5pm on Saturday, 8 Dec and Sunday, 9 Dec 2018. Participants are required to attend BOTH days of the workshop.**

Participants are required to pay a material fee of $45 directly to the trainer during workshop registration to attend this workshop.

This 2-day (8 hours in total) course aims to teach participants how to build a Bluetooth-controlled robotic smart car with obstacle avoidance capability through ultrasound sensors. Participants will learn how to put the robot together and the role of each sub-system within a robot - micro:bit, motor driver, motors, sensor & other actuators. MakeCode graphical programming platform will be used to program the robot.

This workshop will be held at Jurong Regional Library.

The training provided in this workshop is sponsored by IMDA.
