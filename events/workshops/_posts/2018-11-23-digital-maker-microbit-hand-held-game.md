**Participate in our Digital Maker workshop and bring home a micro:bit! In this 2-hour workshop, you will learn how to program the micro:bit, and assemble your very own portable game device that runs off your micro:bit! It’ll have sound, buttons, and you’ll play your game on the micro:bit’s display.**

As part of the Digital Maker programme initiative, registered participants for the workshops can bring home a ONE-TIME free issue of the pocket-sized micro:bit , sponsored by IMDA.

**Terms of receiving a free micro:bit**

Recipient must be receiving their free micro:bit from IMDA for the first time. This covers all other previous activities beyond the Library PIXEL Labs (eg, other workshops, schools).
