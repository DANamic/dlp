This workshop introduces participants to micro:bit hardware, the block-based programming environment, PXT and create a simple greeting message using animations and text with musical notes when button A is pressed. Make a simple greeting card with musical notes using the piezo speaker strawbees and cardboard. Material fee ($12 per pax) include one piezo buzzer, 2 crocodile wires, strawbees and customised cardboard.

Participants will also learn how to:

- Give instructions using the block-based programming environment to display different images,
- Upload the program onto the microcontroller
- To display messages and music by pressing a button
- Program the piezo speaker and connect to the micro:bit to play musical notes when button A is pressed.
