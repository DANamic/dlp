This 2-hour workshop allows the parent-child pairs to construct a self-driving micro:bit car. This introductory workshop will bring you into the world of digital making with micro:bit, electronics components, and Microsoft MakeCode platform.

 

This workshop will be held at Jurong Regional Library.

 

This workshop is for parent-child pairs to participate.  The child needs to be at least 7 years old paired with either a parent or a guardian of age at least 18 years old and above.
Each pair is entitled to only one micro:bit and a set of kit. Hence, participants are required to bring their own micro:bits if they have received one from IMDA Digital Maker workshops previously.

 

The workshop and the micro:bits are sponsored by IMDA.  However, there will be material costs involved and each set of kit costs $25.  Parents are to pay the trainers directly for the kits at the workshop during registration to bring back the project.

 

Admission is free and registration is required. Click <a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/golibrary2/e/digital-maker-mini-basketball-catapult-pixel-labsnlb-41280655" target="_blank">here</a> to register or at library e-kiosks or at http://nlb.gov.sg/golibrary. 

A minimum of 10 pairs is required to start the workshop.
