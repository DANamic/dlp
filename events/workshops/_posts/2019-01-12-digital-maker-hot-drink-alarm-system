This workshop is suitable for participants aged 10 and above. Registration is required and material fee ** ($20 per participant) ** is payable to the organizer. Registration is required at library book borrowing station or click <a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/golibrary2/e/hot-drink-alarm-system-sl2-pixel-labsnlb-28560855" target="_blank">here</a>  to register!

** Participate in our Hot Drink Alarm System Digital Maker workshop and bring home a micro:bit! Sometimes a hot beverage can burn your tongue. Use the Micro:Bit to alert you when your hot beverage is at the right temperature for you to drink. Learn how to create an alert system using conditional statements, temperature sensor and sound. **
As part of the Digital Maker programme initiative, registered participants for the workshops can bring home a ONE-TIME free issue of the pocket-sized micro:bit , sponsored by IMDA.

Terms of receiving a free micro:bit

Recipient must be an eligible participant of the workshop

Recipient must be receiving their free micro:bit from IMDA for the first time. This covers all other previous activities beyond the Library Pixel Labs (eg, other workshops, schools).

The material fees charged for this workshop do not include any micro:bit.

If the participant has already collected a free micro:bit previously, they may bring it along for this workshop. Otherwise, one may be loaned to the participant, while stocks last from a limited supply. Loaned micro:bit must be returned in full, undamaged condition at the end of the workshop.

** Material Fee **

** Age Requirements** 
A minimum age of 10 is required for attending this activity. This is due to the technical complexity of the workshop and hands-on dexterity needed for handling the materials.
