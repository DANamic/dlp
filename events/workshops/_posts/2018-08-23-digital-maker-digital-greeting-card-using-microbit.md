In August, we come together to commemorate and celebrate Singaporeâ€™s independence.  Come join us at our 2-hours Digital Maker workshops to express your well wishes for our nation by coding and making some interesting projects.  In the 2-hour workshop, you will  be introduced to the micro:bit hardware, the block-based programming environment and how to create a digital greeting card using the micro:bit.

Participants will also learn how to:
Give instructions using the block-based programming environment to display different images,
Upload the program onto the microcontroller,
Use push buttons on the micro:bit as a form of input,
Display messages and music by pressing a button.
The workshop and the micro:bits are sponsored by IMDA.  However, there will be material costs involved and each set of kit costs $12.  Participants are to pay the trainers directly for the kits at the workshop at the start of the registration to bring back the project.

A minimum of 10 participants is required to start the workshop.

Participants are advised to arrive 15 minutes before the start of the workshop, as allocated seats will be released to interested participants 5 minutes after the start of the workshop.
