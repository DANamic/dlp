Digital Maker programme aims to cultivate a community of innovators, imbued with the culture of collaboration and co-creation, to solve real-world problems. 

Launched in April 2017, the 2-year Digital Maker Programme reached out to schools and community to introduce digital making through a simple-to-use and open-ended technology called the “micro:bit” that students and adults will find comfortable to use, and inspire them to explore the possibilities of creating with technology.

Under this programme, we provided interested primary and secondary schools with micro:bits for up to one cohort of their students. Together with our partner Microsoft, we equip school teachers with basic skills of digital making using the micro:bit and show them the possibilities of infusing digital making in lessons and/or schools’ programmes.  To date, we have 220 schools on board the programme, and we continue to share the lesson ideas by our teachers and build a community of maker educators.
