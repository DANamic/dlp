Early childhood educators can now look forward to educators’ workshops to understand more about age- and developmentally-appropriate technologies for pre-schoolers and how to infuse them into their curriculum. “Tech Toys in Pre-school Classroom” certification course is conducted by the Association for Early Childhood Educators (Singapore) or AECES with subsidies from SkillsFuture SG (SSG). During the 2.5 days' course over 2 months, educators can also borrow some of these tech toys to incorporate into their lessons back at their pre-school centres. 

For more details on the course fee and dates, please refer to AECES website <a href="http://www.aeces.org" target="_blank">here</a> [here](http://www.aeces.org)
