The Code for Fun Enrichment Programme (offered jointly by IMDA and MOE) is offered to all MOE primary and secondary schools to increase studentsâ€™ exposure to coding and computational thinking. The programme includes academic learning of related concepts using visual-based programming language, combining it with robotic kits and/or microcontrollers, to create a coding experience for the students.

<br> The Code for Fun Enrichment Programme aims to:
* Facilitate the exposure of a large base of students to coding and computational thinking; and
* Help build an entire generation of workforce inculcated with basic coding and computational thinking skills. <br>

We are currently reviewing the programme to make it better. More details will be released by September 2019.
