**For Early Childhood Educators**

![certification course image](/images/in-schools/playmaker/certification-course/playmaker-certification-course.jpg)

Early childhood educators can now look forward to Educators’ workshops to understand more about age- and developmentally-appropriate technologies for pre-schoolers and how to infuse them into their curriculum. “Tech Toys in pre-school classroom” certification course is conducted by Association for Early Childhood Educators (Singapore) or AECES with subsidies from SkillsFuture SG (SSG). During the 2.5 days of course over 2 months, Educators can also borrow some of these Tech Toys to incorporate into their lessons back at their pre-school centres. 

For more details on the course fee and dates, please refer to AECES website at [www.aeces.org](www.aeces.org)
