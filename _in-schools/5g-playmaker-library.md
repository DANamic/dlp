#### PlayMaker Library

IMDA is setting up a PlayMaker library for pre-schools to borrow tech toys to support pre-school educators in the use of technology in the classroom. 

Pre-schools can borrow the tech toys for a short period of time and use them during their lessons to introduce Computational Thinking to the pre-schoolers. 

New and emerging tech toys that are suitable for the pre-schoolers will be continuously curated. 

Look out for more information on our <a href="https://codesg.imda.gov.sg/in-schools/playmaker-overview/" target ="_blank">website</a> in April 2020!
