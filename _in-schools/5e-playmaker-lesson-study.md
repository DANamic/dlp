IMDA commissioned a collaborative aciton research with Temasek Polytechnic and 6 pre-school centres to develop resources to guide pre-school educators in planning, implementing and reflecting on lessons involving the PlayMaker pedagogy and the use of tech toys in their lessons at the pre-school centres. 

The PlayMaker pedagogy combines the well-established theoretical underpinnings of the key role of play in a childâ€™s learning and development with maker-centred learnings which encourage tinkering experiences for innovation. Such experiences can help children to innovate and invent in a fun and active way.

The 6 pre-schools involved in this study investigated and documented how tech toys can support development of PlayMaker pedagogy in the classrooms, based on the Nurturing Early Learners (NEL) principles and learning goals. Each of the pre-schools developed a lesson plan and a video to capture their observations to share with the early childhood educators.

To understand our PlayMaker program better, the following videos, coupled with their respective lesson plans, explain how incorporating tech toys into play will inspire children to become more innovative and imaginative.
