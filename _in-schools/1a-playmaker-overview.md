PlayMaker aims to inspire young children to play and make with technology, sparking imagination and building creative confidence.

In 2016, PlayMaker was piloted at 160 pre-schools in Singapore, giving pre-schoolers an early exposure to computational thinking and robotics with age and developmentally-appropriate technology. Robotics offers a playful and collaborative way for children to engage with foundational technology and engineering concepts during their formative early childhood years. Young children are inspired to create with technology, experiment, fail and try again, imbuing them with the confidence to be creative.

**Technology-enabled Toys**

We constantly curate tech toys that introduce computational thinking, programming concepts and help develop creativity, imagination and problem-solving skills in young children. These tech toys offer tactile and kinesthetic experiences that young children need, with little to no screen time required.
